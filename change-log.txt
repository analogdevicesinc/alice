Version 1.3.12 Jan 3 2022
* Extend Bode frequency sweep lowest frequency to 1.6 Hz (100KSPS/65536)
* Extend resistance/div ploting display lowest range to 0.01 ohms/div
* When loading AWG waveform data from CSV files the AWG channel Max value is added as an offset to the data values in the file. Set Max to 0 to add no offset.
* Misc. typographical errors fixed

Version 1.3.11 Aug 20 2021
* New slow rolling time sweep mode implemented, similar to strip-chart. Sample rate varies depending on host computer speed.
* In Spectrum Analyzer, vertical amplitude scale can now be in dB or RMS volts as well as Power Spectral Density (PSD) dB/rtHz or mV/rtHz (useful for noise testing).
* Major rework to XY plotting tool to support multiple Y axis traces vs single X axis.
* In the AWG controls it is now possible to add noise to most waveform shapes (except libsmu built-in shapes).
* In the Digital Filter tool it is now possible to apply digital filters to the AWG buffers.
* Optional User Entry widgets added to Scope and XY screens.
* Improvements / simplifications to scripting functionality.
* Pyplot functions from matplotlib now included (as plt).
* Many new test signal and digital filter generation functions added.

Version 1.3.10 May 7 2021
* add support for conda packages
* Initialization file name (alice_init.ini) can now be passed on command line
* Enhanced external analog multiplexer functions including new Chop Mode
  - Trace averaging for mux traces implemented
  - Export mux trace data to csv file implemented
* More checking is done for allowed combinations when switching to 200 KSPS modes
* Other misc. typo and bug fixes

Version 1.3.9 Dec 5 2020
* More changes to ways to modify UI look and feel.
* Fix Mac OSX specific tkinter typo.
* Fix Mac OSX specific keyboard arrow keys typo.
* Added initialization option to combine Scope and AWG controls in same window.
* Added Function Sine_Phase() to calculate relative phase angle between two sine waves of the same frequency in VBuffA, VBuffB, Removes any DC content returns relative phase in range 0 to 180 deg.
* Added Function SchroederPhase(Length, NrTones, Ampl) to Generate a Schroeder Phase (Multi-tone) of Length samples and having NrTones. Returns a waveform array
* Modified how tracking cursor text is displayed
* Added more display data combinations in XY grid markers
* Added reset buttons to set external channel gain and offset to 1.0 and 0.0.
* Added initialization option to swap the channel range and position labels and entry widgets
* Added first pass at local language configuration by editing language_config.cfg file. File name set in alice_init.ini. Most UI text label text can be modified as well as balloon help text.
